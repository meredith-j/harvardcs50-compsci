### brainstorm
- chappell roan? or hot to go game?
- powerpuff girls?
- pick your pop icon as player
- CANOE TRIP
- pop girly canoe trip?
- some kind of choose your adventure with mini games where pop girlies go on a canoe trip
- like dnd but in a forest with your faves
- you get to pick a party of pop girlies, each of whom has a special skillset, and then have to have maximum fun canoeing
- could start with a packing list too

# what is beta mode?
- pick one pop girly (if that's not too hard) -- chappell roan, charlie xcx, renee rapp, sabrina carpenter, kesha
- (if picking a pop girl is too hard) pop girly is chappell roan
- name your character (so it's just 2 ppl on the trip)
- map game -- you look at a map and need to find your way to campsite
- map is shown on screen for 5 seconds and then disappears, use arrow keys to navigate on the screen to where you think campsite is
- success: cute lil campsite image with pop girly singing with a nice fire going
- fail: pop girly upset sounds & you crying lmao

### to do
-- to be populated with running list of tasks left before homework is finished (if needed)
