Computers today count using a system called binary. Itâ€™s from the term binary digit that we get a familiar term called bit. A bit is a zero or one: on or off.

# unary counting example: 3 lightbulbs
### values represented by each lightbulb: 4 2 1

to represent 0: 0 0 0

to represent 1: 0 0 1

to represent 2: 0 1 0

to represent 3: 0 1 1

to represent 4: 1 0 0

up to representing 7: 1 1 1

### this uses 'base-2' to count:
2^2  2^1  2^0
4    2    1

### Computers generally use eight bits (also known as a byte) to represent a number. For example, 00000101 is the number 5 in binary. 11111111 represents the number 255.
-- from external source, the binary is equivalent to the equation 2^2 + 2^0 = 5.
