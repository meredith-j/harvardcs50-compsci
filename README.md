# harvardcs50-compsci

this is a repo where i will save my course notes for the Harvard CS50 Intro to Computer Sciences course.

## course goals

since completing a coding bootcamp, i have felt increasingly confident in my coding skills & my ability to write clean code and to think like an engineer. that said, sometimes i want to understand deeper compsci concepts -- WHY did my code work, how can i make it faster?

it feels like a lot of what i know is based in trial and error. this is especially noticeable when i am presented with leetcode questions, which are much easier when you understand concepts like time complexity & data structures. i am hoping to deepen my understanding of these concepts so that i might become more well-rounded as an engineer.

by the end of this course, i would like to be able to write recursive algorithms with ease.
